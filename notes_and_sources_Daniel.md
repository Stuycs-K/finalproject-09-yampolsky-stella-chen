# Columnar Transposition Cipher
## The Columnar Part
The Columnar cipher is a cipher that rearranges plaintext so that it looks quite weird. However, it doesn't change the actual letters like a Caesar Cipher or any polyalphabetic cipher. 

## Example of the Columnar Part
We have this sentence. Let's say the key length was 5. Exclude the spaces and the cipher text would be:<br/>
Wehav<br/>
ethis<br/>
sente<br/>
nce<br/>

If the length of the plaintext is not divisible by the key length, then just add nulls (spaces).
