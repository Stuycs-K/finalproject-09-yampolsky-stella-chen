# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

Daniel Chen and Stella Yampolsky
       
# Intentions:

We are going to demonstrate the Hill Cipher and the Columnar Cipher. These are two physical encryption methods.  
    
# Intended usage:

This project will allow people to automatically encode and decode plaintext and ciphertext using the Hill and Columnar ciphers.
  
# Technical Details:
     
Stella will be doing the Hill Cipher. Daniel will do the Columnar cipher. We will do a code demo and a demo without a computer. We will be including a decode and encode for both ciphers.   
    
# Intended pacing:

By May 20, research everything about the Hill and Columnar Cipher, including its history and methodology.
By May 22, piece together the slides for Hill and Columnar Cipher using Google Slides. 
By May 27, we have working encode and decode for both Ciphers.
By May 30, physical demo, code demo, and presentation. 
By May 31st, we record and edit the video.
