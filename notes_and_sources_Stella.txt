Hill ciper
- Invented by Lester S. Hill
- Polygraphic substitution cipher
	- different from polyalphabetic/monoalphabetic ciphers
	- Uniform substitution is performed on blocks of letters, like the playfair cipher.
- "practical" to operate on more than 3 symbols at once. 
- Uses matrices (I need to learn some math)
- Each block is represented as a matrix (letters are 0-25)
- Encryption: Each block of n letters is multiplied by an nXn matrix against mod 26.
- Decryption: multiply by the inverse of the key matrix mod 26
- Important! Not all matricies have an inverse!! Therefore, the determinant must be nonzero and not divisible by 2 or 13
- The risk of the determinant having common factors with the modulus can be eliminated by making the modulus prime
- add reasoning
- Variant has 3 extra symbols (use this one?), makes modulus 29
- Linear, if you have encrypted and decrypted text you can crack it.
- Can be more effective when combined with non linear operations
- Key space: set of all possible keys
- Key space size: number of possible keys
